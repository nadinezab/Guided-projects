# Guided-projects

**1 Boston Housing Project**
* Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression modelling
* Compiled from Flatiron Data Science Labs
* Uses Scikit-Learn and Statsmodels OLS
* Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Trees
* Key considerations: Feature scaling, feature selection (RFE and stepwise), interacting features, AIC/BIC evaluation

**2 Lego Pricing Project**
* Exploratory Data Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression
* Flatiron Data Science course Appendix to Module 2 practice project
* Uses Scikit-Learn and Statsmodels OLS
* Key considerations: Assumptions checks (residuals normality and homoskedasticity), Variance Inflation Factor

**3 California Housing Project**
* An end to end Regression ML Project
* Following Chapter 2 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*, 2nd Edition by Aurélien Géron
